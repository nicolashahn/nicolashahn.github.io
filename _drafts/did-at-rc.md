I recently spent 12 weeks at [the Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) where I
had a chance to spend my time however I chose to, with the ultimate goal of
becoming a [dramatically better programmer](TODO link to henry's post). Here
are some of the things I did, and what I learned.


## In the first half (six weeks)
* Worked on a Scheme interpreter written in Python
* Wrote a neural net from scratch(well, from `numpy` array)
* Created a python program that can track the beat of music via microphone
* Worked on several exercises to understand Lisp macros
* Quit coffee for 8 weeks
* Created a presentation on `diffimg`
* Wrote a Python program using OpenCV that solves the SET card game from an
    image: it returns the same image with colored boxes drawn around the sets
* Worked with the creater of `oilshell` and wrote code that went into the
    current release

## In the second half
* Paired with a couple others on creating a lisp interpreter in Rust, didn't
    get past the parsing stage
* Worked through some of the cyptopals exercises
* Experimented with an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, the Teensy 3.6
* Worked on the `concurrent-wc` project, wrote the Python implementation and
    paired on the Go one
* Worked through some of the Stripe CTF, discovered how a negative array index
    attack works
* Implemented tetris in PICO-8
* Taught some other recursers about git, Python, web development, scraping
* Hosted a Vim trivia event
* Spent a lot of time brushing up on algorithms and data structures in
    preparation for interviews
