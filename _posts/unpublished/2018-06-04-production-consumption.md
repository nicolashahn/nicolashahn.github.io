I’m currently attending the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com) and there’s something I’ve noticed in trying to make the best use of my time here. "Best" is ultimately defined subjectively, but there is a scale that we can more or less agree on for many activities.

Reading quality literature would rank higher than watching reality TV. Deliberate practice of a musical instrument is better than absentmindedly playing easy phrases while your mind wanders. Conversation about abstract or novel ideas is preferable to gossiping or trading rumors.

Some of these things are on the border - is reading Hacker News a worthwhile use of my time? I'm keeping up to date with current events and occasionally learning neat bits of trivia I can insert into the appropriate conversations. However, reading about [LR parsing](https://jasonhpriestley.com/lr) comes at the expense of my projects and the C/Lisp/ML knowledge I told myself I'd have by the end of the day.

The point is that we can rank these activites on a scale, arbitrarily from -1 to 1. -1 might be finding out how many times you can hit your head against a wall before you pass out. 1 could be working on something you know to be your ultimate purpose in life. Browsing Hacker News would be roughly 0 (and lower when you know you should be working on something else). You want the average score of your daily activites to be high, but we only have so much willpower.

It's good that we have this scale for deciding how to spend our time, but it only measures a single dimension. There are many, but in the context of learning, there's one that I think deserves its own blog post: the balance between consuming information, and producing it. We can also use a scale of -1 to 1 for this, but for for this measure, we're looking for a score of 0 instead of 1.

Examples include reading versus writing, watching videos on how to do thing X and actually doing X. A prime programming example would be the complementary tasks of reading to gain understanding of how an algorithm works, and actually implementing it in the language of your choice. A less obvious example would be listening versus speaking in a conversation.

For most skills, it's required that you balance both. You can believe you understand how an algorithm works by reading a chapter of a textbook, but until you've verified that by writing an implementation, you won't be sure that you can put it to use when you need to. Likewise, you can read dozens of books, but only your ability to read grows, your writing won't (by much, at least).
