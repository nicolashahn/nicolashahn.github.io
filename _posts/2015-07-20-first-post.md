An interesting, possibly controversial opinion. 

Something along the lines of "Now, I know this seems crazy, but hear me out."

A series of factoids, with citations from [dubious sources](http://gawker.com/) or [other blogs.](http://vsinha.com/)

An almost definitely fictional story perfectly demonstrating the main point.

# A quotation from later on in the article in large font.


Midway through, a list of bullet points!

* Easy to read
* Seems like I have more information than I actually do
* Repeat myself in a different format to appear to have more content


Summarization of the material presented and the point of the post.

Memorable and quotable final sentence, on its own line.
