**Nicolas Hahn** has been an artist, photographer, animator, designer, NLP researcher, infrastructure engineer, and web developer. His current status is "[BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)ing through life." He is attending [the Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Afterwards, he may travel and do freelance work (you may want to [hire him](mailto:nicolas@stonespring.org)). He finds it strange to write about himself in the third person. You can find out more about what he's done in the links below.
