Nicolas Hahn is a former artist, photographer, filmmaker, designer, NLP researcher, infrastructure engineer, and web developer. He is currently attending [the Recurse Center](https://recurse.com). Afterwards, he may travel and do freelance work (you may want to [hire him](mailto:nicolas@stonespring.org)). Also, he finds it strange to write about himself in the third person.
